### [Houston Demo Day](http://www.meetup.com/Houstons-Startup-Demo-Day/)
Every month, four Houston startups are given a platform to introduce themselves to the community, pitch before a panel of investors and mentors and get feedback. Hosted by START, normally the 4th Wednesday of the month. Exceptions do happen, so check the Meetup!


### [Lean Startup Circle](http://www.meetup.com/leanhouston/)
Meetup focused on Lean methodologies, with talks by founders, industry panels, "working meetups" and happy hours. Normally 3rd Thursdays of each month, but exceptions do happen, so check the Meetup!


### [Startup Grind](http://startupgrind.com/houston/)
A moderated discussion series and intimate dinner with a Houston startup CEO, often centered on a particular topic. While some groups/events will focus specifically on one industry (i.e. medical, tech, energy), Startup Grind puts a lot of effort into remaining industry-agnostic.


### [Startup Happy Hour](http://www.eventbrite.com/o/joe-martin-amp-josephine-tran-8402419077)
With all of these working meetups, speaker series and events, sometimes its nice to just hang out and get to know one another more informally. Hosted monthly or semi-monthly as a very simple, but very valuable, mixer for the community. Normally the first Thursday of each month.


### [The Platformit Show/House](http://www.platformit.co/)
Platformit it runs two events: "The Platformit Show" and "The Platformit House" on alternating months. The "Show" is a webcast, sit-down interview with local entrepreneurs, and each with a theme. The "House" is a more party atmosphere, but also has a short spotlight of local companies. The Show has featured equal parts small business entrepreneurship and startup entrepreneurship ([clarification here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIA9ikESXYI)). The House has so far leaned toward startups.


### [1 Million Cups](http://houston.sites.1millioncups.com/)
A weekly morning series of startups sharing their stories with each other. Rather than a showy, public pitch, 1 Million Cups is a place to lower your guard, share your story, and discuss the realities of startup life. A safe zone for entrepreneurs to be open among peers.


### [Houston Open Coffee Club](http://www.meetup.com/opencoffeehouston/)
Monthly morning meetup focused on building a community of entrepreneurs, investors, and techies interested in supporting our local businesses and economy.
