### [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/locations/houston/)
A Code School with three separate three-month programs: Front-End Engineering, Full-stack Rails Engineering and Mobile Engineering. They also do free kids classes which is freaking awesome! For any startup hiring developers in those categories, their graduation & demo day is a must-attend. Easiest way to know when it's coming is to join [The Iron Yard's Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/The-Iron-Yard-Houston/) or their mailing list.


### [Coder Camps](http://www.meetup.com/Coder-Camps/)
A Code School with two programs in Houston: Full-stack .NET and Full-stack JavaScript. Students can, however, take the course online/remote from other cities if the Houston class' schedule somehow isn't right for you. For startups in need of .NET developers, that program has been running in Houston since their very first class and they've recently added Full-stack JS locally as well! Watch for their demo days to come down the pipeline on [The Coder Camps Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/Coder-Camps/).


### [Tech Meetups Around Town](http://www.meetup.com/find/tech)
Hiring for a specific skill? Houston has so many tech-focused groups on Meetup that it's impossible to keep track of them all. There are language-focused, topic-focused, tool-focused and industry catch-all groups. Several of them make time for a "Who's Hiring" bit at the start to get it out of the way, and others prefer you chip in as a sponsor.

If you attend one solely to hire people, rather than discuss the tech topic at hand, just remember to be humble and respectful: You're a guest in their house, and they don't owe you nothin'.
